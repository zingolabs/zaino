## Visibility: minimum required scope

All items (functions, methods, structs, enums, fields, modules) MUST use the
most restrictive visibility that compiles. Start with no visibility qualifier
(private). Only widen when the compiler rejects it, and then use the narrowest
scope that works:

1. `(private)` — default, no qualifier
2. `pub(super)` — visible to the parent module
3. `pub(crate)` — visible within the crate
4. `pub` — visible to external consumers

Never preemptively make something `pub`. If a test needs access to an internal,
prefer `pub(crate)` or a `#[cfg(test)]` helper over `pub`. If an item is only
used within its own module, it stays private even if "it might be useful later."

## DRY: deduplicate with functions first

Always produce the DRYest implementation possible. When eliminating
duplication, prefer plain functions (`fn`) over macros or other patterns.
Resort to macros only when `fn` cannot express the abstraction (e.g. the
call site requires a string literal, or the pattern spans syntactic
constructs that functions cannot capture).

## Test attributes: minimum justified complexity

Every test starts at `#[test]`. Escalate only when the test body demands
it, and pick the narrowest escalation that works:

1. `#[test]` — default. Synchronous tests.
2. `#[tokio::test]` (current-thread) — the test body actually uses `.await`.
3. `#[tokio::test(flavor = "multi_thread")]` — the test genuinely requires
   multiple OS threads (a race under test, `spawn_blocking` that must run
   concurrently with the test future, code that would deadlock on
   current-thread).

Never inherit a heavier attribute from a neighbouring test by convention —
each test is justified on its own body. `multi_thread` is not a free
upgrade: it adds runtime-startup cost, introduces scheduling
nondeterminism, and can mask bugs that would surface on current-thread.

When auditing or adding a test, verify the justification by reading the
body: is there any `.await`? Any task spawn? Any reliance on real
timers? If not, downgrade. Leave a brief comment only if the choice is
non-obvious (e.g. "multi_thread required: test exercises a race between
writer and reader on the db").
