## Visibility: minimum required scope

All items (functions, methods, structs, enums, fields, modules) MUST use the
most restrictive visibility that compiles. Start with no visibility qualifier
(private). Only widen when the compiler rejects it, and then use the narrowest
scope that works:

1. `(private)` — default, no qualifier
2. `pub(super)` — visible to the parent module
3. `pub(crate)` — visible within the crate
4. `pub` — visible to external consumers

Never preemptively make something `pub`. If a test needs access to an internal,
prefer `pub(crate)` or a `#[cfg(test)]` helper over `pub`. If an item is only
used within its own module, it stays private even if "it might be useful later."

## DRY: deduplicate with functions first

Always produce the DRYest implementation possible. When eliminating
duplication, prefer plain functions (`fn`) over macros or other patterns.
Resort to macros only when `fn` cannot express the abstraction (e.g. the
call site requires a string literal, or the pattern spans syntactic
constructs that functions cannot capture).
